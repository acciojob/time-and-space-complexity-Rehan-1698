	<h1>	Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient This measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It is often expressed in Big O notation (like O(n), O(log n), O(nÂ²)) which helps describe how the running time increases as the input grows. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means the time grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> Space Complexity, O(n) This measures the amount of memory (space) an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It tells you how much additional memory is required besides the input data. Like time complexity, space complexity is also typically described in Big O notation. For instance, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity will need memory proportional to the size of the input.</p>
